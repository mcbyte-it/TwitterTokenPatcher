Twitter Token Patcher (Xposed)
version 0.3 (Beta)

Description:
------------
This Xposed module will patch the Twitter API Tokens of the supported apps to an individual token
(Created on the dev.twitter.com), to bypass the 100k token limit (imposed by Twitter).

Currently the patcher works with:
- Carbon (by dots and lines)
- Janetter (by Jane Inc.)

Others will come soon, thanks for YOUR support and contribution.
